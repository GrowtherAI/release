# Growther.ai C5 installer (Windows)  ·  irm https://growther.ai/install.ps1 | iex
#
# Downloads the self-contained V8-bytecode binary for this arch from GitHub
# Releases, verifies SHA-256, installs it on PATH, and seeds %USERPROFILE%\.growther
# with the signed build manifest (verified at runtime).
#
# Env overrides: GROWTHER_VERSION, GROWTHER_INSTALL_DIR, GROWTHER_HOME,
#                GROWTHER_RELEASE_BASE, GROWTHER_NO_MODIFY_PATH=1
#
# Enterprise install profile (Intune Win32 in user context, SCCM, a signed MSI's
# custom action). Every flag has a GROWTHER_* equivalent so a deployment tool
# that can only set environment variables reaches the same behaviour, and an
# invocation that passes none of them behaves exactly as it always did. Both
# spellings are accepted (-ManagedInstall and --managed-install) so one Intune
# command line can be kept in step with install.sh:
#
#   -PolicyExpected   GROWTHER_POLICY_EXPECTED=1
#       Write %USERPROFILE%\.growther\policy-expected. Its presence tells C5
#       policy is coming: the anonymous first-user bootstrap is off (nobody who
#       opens the tab first becomes admin), missing policy is reported rather
#       than assumed, and doctor says "managed install".
#   -ManagedInstall   GROWTHER_MANAGED_INSTALL=1
#       Write a `managed-install` marker beside growther.exe. C5 then never
#       copies itself elsewhere and `growther update` reports the available
#       version but REFUSES the swap, naming whoever owns the install — which is
#       what keeps the on-disk version equal to the version Intune believes it
#       shipped.
#   -ManagedBy <label>  GROWTHER_MANAGED_BY
#       Who that refusal names. Defaults to this script; the MSI passes its own
#       label so an operator is sent to the right place.
#   -NoActivate       GROWTHER_NO_ACTIVATE=1
#       Set GROWTHER_NO_AUTO_ACTIVATE=1 in the config C5 loads at every launch,
#       so first run does not open a browser to activate.
#   -InstallService   GROWTHER_INSTALL_SERVICE=1
#   -Home <dir>       (this run's home; GROWTHER_HOME)
#   -DataDir <dir>    GROWTHER_DATA_DIR
#       Recorded in the device pointer %USERPROFILE%\.growther\home.json, the
#       one file every launch reads to find them (the scheduled task carries no
#       home path). GROWTHER_HOME alone keeps its old meaning; the pointer is
#       written only when -Home or -DataDir asks for it, so an unattended re-run
#       cannot silently repoint a machine whose data is elsewhere.
#   -ProfileOnly      GROWTHER_PROFILE_ONLY=1
#       The binary is ALREADY on disk — the signed MSI (packaging/msi) placed it
#       — so skip the download, the checksum, the extract and the PATH edit and
#       apply only the options above to GROWTHER_INSTALL_DIR. This is the flag
#       that keeps the MSI free of configuration logic: it lays down a signed
#       payload and then runs THIS script, so there is exactly one implementation
#       of what -ManagedInstall or -DataDir mean. Not for interactive use.

Options (each has a GROWTHER_* environment equivalent):
  -PolicyExpected    mark this install as centrally managed (policy is coming)
  -ManagedInstall    an MSI/MDM owns the binary: no self-install, check-only updates
  -ManagedBy <label> who to name as that owner (default: this script)
  -NoActivate        do not open a browser to activate on first run

  -DataDir <dir>     where the databases live (recorded in the same pointer)
