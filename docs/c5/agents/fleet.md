# Your agent fleet

Your **fleet** is the group of agents you have running. The Fleet page is where you see
them, add more, and check on their health.

## Why run several at once

More agents means more work happening at the same time. If you have five separate things
to do, five agents can do them together instead of one doing them in a row.

The limit is your computer and your budget, not C5.

## What is on the Fleet page

| Tab            | What it is for                                              |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Roster**     | Every agent you have, and what it is for.                    |
| **Assignment** | Which agent is working on what.                              |
| **Deployment** | Starting up new agents.                                      |
| **Health**     | How each agent is doing.                                     |

## Separate workspaces

Each agent can work in its own isolated space. Changes one agent makes do not disturb
another until you decide to bring the work together.

This matters most when agents are editing files. Without separation, two agents changing
the same file at the same time would collide and you would get a mess. With separation,
each works on its own copy and you review the results.

## Adding agents

1. Go to **Fleet**.
2. Open **Deployment**.
3. Choose how many agents you want and what they should focus on.
4. Start them.

New agents pick up waiting work right away.

## How many should you run?

Start with the default. Add more when you actually see work waiting in the queue.

Signs you could use more:

- The queue on [Monitor](/c5/using-c5/monitor) stays long
- Tasks sit in "To do" for a long time before starting
- Your computer is not working hard

Signs you have too many:

- Your computer is slow at everything else
- Costs are climbing faster than work is finishing
- Agents are idle

> **Warning**
> Every running agent can spend money. Set a budget in [Ops](/c5/using-c5/ops) before
> you grow your fleet.

## Health

The Health tab shows whether each agent is working normally, struggling, or stopped.

An agent that keeps failing usually has a cause you can fix — a missing key, a permission
it does not have, a model that is unavailable. Click into it to see.

## Where to go next

- [How work gets done](/c5/agents/how-it-works) — the bigger picture.
- [Budgets](/c5/using-c5/ops) — keeping costs under control as you grow.
