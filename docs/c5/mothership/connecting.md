# Connecting

Connecting to Mothership takes one command.

```bash
growther activate
```

## What happens

1. C5 shows you a short code.
2. It opens a page in your browser.
3. You confirm the code there.
4. The two are linked.

The code proves the request came from your machine. Nobody can connect your install
without you approving it in a browser you control.

## Checking it worked

```bash
growther doctor
```

The output includes your license and Mothership state. You can also see it inside the
app, in Settings.

## Connecting more machines

Run `growther activate` on each one. Every machine gets its own code and its own
approval step.

Once several machines are connected, you can see them together in your Mothership
dashboards.

## If activation fails

**"Cannot reach the activation service"**
A network or firewall problem. C5 needs to reach `api.growther.ai` for this step. It
keeps working offline — you just cannot activate until it can connect.

**"Code expired"**
Codes are short-lived on purpose. Run `growther activate` again for a fresh one.

**"Already activated"**
This machine is connected. Nothing to do.

**"License limit reached"**
Your plan covers a certain number of machines. Disconnect one you no longer use, or
change plan.

## Working offline after connecting

Connected does not mean dependent. If your internet drops, C5 keeps running: your agents
work, your tasks run, your files save. It syncs up again when the connection returns.

## Disconnecting

You can disconnect from Settings at any time.

When you do:

- Everything on your computer stays exactly where it is
- Your projects, files, and history are untouched
- C5 keeps working as a standalone install
- Combined dashboards and shared improvements stop

There is no penalty and no lock-in. You can reconnect later with `growther activate`.
