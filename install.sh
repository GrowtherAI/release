# Growther.ai C5 installer  ·  curl -fsSL https://growther.ai/install.sh | bash
#
# Downloads the self-contained V8-bytecode binary for this OS/arch from GitHub
# Releases, verifies its SHA-256, installs it on PATH, and seeds ~/.growther with
# the signed build manifest. The app itself verifies that manifest's Ed25519
# signature at runtime (SOC 2 Change Management).
#
# Env overrides (all optional):
#   GROWTHER_VERSION        release tag to install (default: latest)
#   GROWTHER_INSTALL_DIR    where the binary goes    (default: ~/.local/bin)
#   GROWTHER_HOME           data dir                 (default: ~/.growther)
#   GROWTHER_RELEASE_BASE   release host base URL    (default: growtherai/release raw mirror)
#   GROWTHER_INSTALL_SERVICE=1   install a launchd/systemd user service
#   GROWTHER_NO_MODIFY_PATH=1    don't touch shell rc files
#
# Enterprise install profile (Intune Win32 user context, Jamf, Ansible, a PKG
# postinstall). Every flag has a GROWTHER_* equivalent so a deployment tool that
# can only set environment variables reaches the same behaviour, and passing
# none of them leaves this script doing exactly what it always did:
#
#   --policy-expected     GROWTHER_POLICY_EXPECTED=1
#       Write ~/.growther/policy-expected. Its presence tells C5 that policy is
#       coming: the anonymous first-user bootstrap is disabled (nobody who opens
#       the tab first becomes the admin), missing policy is reported rather than
#       assumed, and doctor says "managed install". The first administrator then
#       comes from `growther user bootstrap-admin` or the identity provider.
#   --managed-install     GROWTHER_MANAGED_INSTALL=1
#       Write a `managed-install` marker beside the binary. C5 then treats the
#       binary the way it treats a Homebrew one: it never copies itself
#       elsewhere, and `growther update` reports the available version and
#       REFUSES the swap, naming whoever owns the install. Use it whenever an
#       MSI, PKG, MDM or configuration-management tool owns the file.
#   --managed-by <label>  GROWTHER_MANAGED_BY
#       Who that refusal names. Defaults to this script; the MSI and PKG pass
#       their own label so an operator is sent to the right place.
#   --no-activate         GROWTHER_NO_ACTIVATE=1
#       Set GROWTHER_NO_AUTO_ACTIVATE=1 in the config C5 loads at every launch
#       (service or terminal), so first run does not open a browser to activate.
#       For fleets that seed a licence by policy instead.
#   --install-service     GROWTHER_INSTALL_SERVICE=1
#   --home <dir>          (this run's home; see GROWTHER_HOME above)
#   --data-dir <dir>      GROWTHER_DATA_DIR
#       Where the home and the databases live. Because service units no longer
#       bake a home path, these are recorded in the device pointer
#       ~/.growther/home.json — the one file every launch reads to find them.
#       GROWTHER_HOME alone keeps its old meaning (the home THIS run seeds); the
#       pointer is written only when --home or --data-dir asks for it, so an
#       unattended re-run cannot silently repoint a machine that already has data.
#   --profile-only        GROWTHER_PROFILE_ONLY=1
#       The binary is ALREADY on disk — a signed PKG (packaging/pkg) placed it —
#       so skip the download, the checksum, the extract and the PATH edit and
#       apply only the enterprise profile above to GROWTHER_INSTALL_DIR. This is
#       the flag that keeps the packages free of configuration logic: they place
#       a signed payload and then run THIS script, so there is exactly one
#       implementation of what `--managed-install` or `--data-dir` mean. It is
#       not for interactive use; on its own it does nothing at all.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# THIS FILE IS CANONICAL. growther.ai serves it (marketing repo, public/install.sh)
# and growtherai/release publishes it — both are mirrors checked against this
# copy by hash. There used to be three hand-maintained variants: the one people
# actually ran (growther.ai) had the signed-release pin but not the icon stamp;
# this one had the icon stamp but not the pin. One file now carries both.

# ── Enterprise profile flags ────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Parsed FIRST, before anything is resolved or downloaded: --home decides where
# the manifest is seeded, and an unknown flag must fail before the network is
# touched rather than after a binary has landed. `die()` is not defined yet

Growther.ai C5 installer

Options (each has a GROWTHER_* environment equivalent):
  --policy-expected     mark this install as centrally managed (policy is coming)
  --managed-install     an MSI/PKG/MDM owns the binary: no self-install, check-only updates
  --managed-by <label>  who to name as that owner (default: this script)
  --no-activate         do not open a browser to activate on first run
  --install-service     register auto-start (launchd / systemd --user)
  --home <dir>          where C5's home lives (recorded in ~/.growther/home.json)
  --data-dir <dir>      where the databases live (recorded in the same pointer)
  --profile-only        the binary is already installed (a signed PKG placed it):
